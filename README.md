I used Vite and valuable files for you. Their logo.png image is in the public directory, and in the src directory, there is a types folder and two components: App and MyPDF. App is where I rendered the MyPDF component. In MyPDF, I used CSS for styling, keeping everything there for simplicity. The other component is the types folder, which stores a custom type. To be honest, we can add it to the MyPDF component.
